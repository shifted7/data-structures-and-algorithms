### Code challenge class 01: Array Reverse
- Write a function called reverseArray which takes an array as an argument. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with elements in reversed order.

#### Approach and Efficiency
- This code uses a for loop to iterate over the new array, and set its index values in ascending order. It sets these values equal to the input array's index values in descending order.
- The big O is O(n)
